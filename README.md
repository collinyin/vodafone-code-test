# Vodafone: Code Test - CRO Frontend Engineer
- In this repository there are 2 folders; one for the responsive web component (called 'responsive-web-component') and one for the reshaping of https://www.vodafone.com.au/nbn

## Response Web Component
- **To use:** Navigate to ./vodafone-code-test/responsive-web-component/html and open index.html
- I hope this web component has been made in such a way where things are self explanatory!

## Reshaping NBN Plan webpage
- **To use:** Copy and paste everything in 'snippet.js' to the console of https://www.vodafone.com.au/nbn and press enter
- **Note:** Apologies, I wasn't able to fully finish c. and d. (see comments in the script)
